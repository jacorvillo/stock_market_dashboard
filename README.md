## Features

This dashboard provides real-time US stock data from Yahoo Finance with multiple timeframes. Works with any stock symbol (so long as it's available)

As of now, the dashboard includes:

- **Scanner**: Find US stocks and ETFs based on technical indicators and other criteria
- **Analysis** (Ongoing): View real-time stock data at multiple timeframes with technical indicators. Includes Impulse System visualization

> *Timeframe can be changed for these indicators

> [!IMPORTANT] 
> Indicators that I plan to add:

## Notes
- This is for educational purposes only, it is NOT financial advice and I am not responsible for any financial losses you take!
- Data may have slight delays during high market volatility. I'm doing what I can to improve performance, but since it is heavily dependent on the Yahoo Finance API, there may be limitations

## Todo

- [ ] (Short term) Implement additional technical indicators
- [ ] (Short/long term) Insights: signals (buy/sell) based on technical indicators, both in the chart and as alerts
- [ ] (Longer term) Add popular system trading strategies (Triple Screen Trading System, ~~Impulse System, Channel trading~~)
- [ ] (Longer term) Analysis: Add backtesting functionality to test strategies against historical data
